    <h1>Pledge of Bloatfree Software</h1>
    <p>
        I hereby pledge that I will, to the best of my ability:
        <ul>
            <li>- try to actively and continuously reduce bloat and;</li>
            <li>- be mindful of efficiency, speed, and environmental and material cost</li>
        </ul>
            In all of:
        <ul>
            <li>- the software that I write and;</li>
            <li>- the hardware I design and;</li>
            <li>- the specifications that I write.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This is not lawfully binding of course, the point of this pledge is to put my mind at ease about the waste that occurs in our finite world. You are welcome to scrutinise me and offer (kind) criticism, and feedback, for all the materials and stuff that I produce. I know that I have much to learn.</p>
    <p>This pledge is part of my beginnings of acting instead of just thinking.</p>
    <p>We not only have to think about how much we waste, we also have to do something about it.</p>
